There is very little documention on how to get WMI information on Linux so here are some rough steps you will need to take.

# Modeprobe wmi-bmof to show the WMI devices at /sys/bus/wmi/devices/*
sudo modprobe wmi-bmof

# Clone the bmf decoder tools repo and build them
git clone https://github.com/pali/bmfdec.git
cd bmfdec
make

# We will need sudo to run `bmf2mof` and give it a path to a wmi device
sudo ./bmf2mof /sys/bus/wmi/devices/05901221-D566-11D1-B2F0-00A0C9062910/bmof
